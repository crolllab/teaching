# Bioinformatics Tools

Prof. Daniel Croll, PD Dr. Nikolai Ivanov, assistants

The course aims to make all participating students proficient in all basic areas of bioinformatics. We particularly focus on the needs of modern biology to treat large amounts of data and automate analyses procedures. The course is structured into lectures that introduce some key areas of bioinformatics followed by practicals on the computer to provide first hand experience. Lecturers and students will be available for ample discussions of tools and approaches. The content of this course includes the following topics: 1- Introduction to Unix and scripting 2- Sequencing analysis 3- Genome assembly 4- Phenotype-genotype associations 5- Epigenetics


## How to access the "shell" and RStudio for the exercises

Our lab offers for you the possibility to access RStudio Server. This allows you to use RStudio from a web browser whether you are in a computer room at UniMail or connect from home. RStudio provides you with

**Following from home [currently not possible!]**  
- Connect using [Webaccess UNINE](https://webaccess.unine.ch)  
- Navigate to "Logiciels VPN" to download a VPN client (there are also iOS/Android options for tablets) & install it.
- Launch a VPN connection.  

**Access the website to the server [currently only possible from PCs in the computer room, not the wifi]**
- Use a web browser to navigate to this site here: [http://130.125.25.239:8787](http://130.125.25.239:8787) (if no page is loading, you may have issues with your VPN connection)

  - Anything you save while using RStudio is on the server.
  - To **to transfer a file to the server**: Find the "Files" tab (typically bottom right of the RStudio screen), click on "Upload" and select "Choose File". The file will upload and you can spot it now under "Files".

  - Saving files from the server is likely most important to recover your written script.
