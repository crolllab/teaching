# Bioinformatics Tools

Prof. Daniel Croll, PD Dr. Nikolai Ivanov

The course aims to introduce students to diverse areas of bioinformatics. We particularly focus on the needs of modern biology to treat large amounts of data and automate analyses procedures. The course is structured into lectures that introduce some key areas of bioinformatics followed by practicals on the computer to provide hands-on experience. Lecturers and students will be available for discussions of tools and approaches. The content of this course includes the following topics:
- Introduction to Unix and scripting
- Sequencing analysis
- Genome assembly
- Epigenetics
(Not offered: Phenotype-genotype associations)

## How to access the "shell" and RStudio for the exercises

Our lab offers you the possibility to access RStudio Server. This allows you to use RStudio from a web browser.

**Access the RStudio website**
- Only possible from the Unimail computer rooms OR from a device connected to the `unine` wifi
- Use a web browser to navigate to this site here: [http://legcompute2.unine.ch:8787](http://legcompute2.unine.ch:8787)

- Please request your username by adding your first name [here in this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mE2cfUr14qA17YftYb2O4ualr3K9wKWXXtxEknLZuU0/edit?usp=sharing). Wait until your account was created ("OK" mark).  
- Your password is: `bioinfo24`   
- Anything you save while using RStudio is on the server.
- **To transfer a file to the server**: Find the "Files" tab (typically bottom right of the RStudio screen), click on "Upload" and select "Choose File". The file will upload and you can spot it now under "Files".

  - To **recover a file from the server and save it on your computer**: Find the "Files" tab (typically bottom right of the RStudio screen), select the file(s) to download, click on "More" and then "Export...". This will get you to the download stage

  - Saving files from the server is likely most important to recover your written script.
